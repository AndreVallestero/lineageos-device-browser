# lineageos-device-browser
Browse LineageOS supported devices in a tabular format

- device data: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LineageOS/lineage_wiki/master/_data/devices/<codename>.yml`
- device pages: `https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/<codename>`

## TODO
- Add toggle for unmaintained devices
- Get a better name (and a domain), maybe "LOS Browser"?
- Prettify and use the same styling as the LOS wiki
- Add toggle for columns
- Make each column sortable by clicking on the column header
- Slightly alternate color between rows
- Add links to device XDA page
- Make the html compliant / up-to-spec
