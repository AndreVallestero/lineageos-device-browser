# lineageos-device-browser
Browse LineageOS supported devices in a tabular format

- device list: `https://wiki.lineageos.org/search.json`
- device data: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LineageOS/lineage_wiki/master/_data/devices/<codename>.yml`
- device pages: `https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/<codename>`

## TODO
- Use a different static site generator, Jekyll + Liquid isn't able to format and parse as needed. Will likely use Hugo or Gatsby.
